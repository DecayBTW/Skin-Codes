# Skin-Codes
This is an list of all the fortnite cosmetics + codes.                                                                                     
You can use the codes to swap around diffrent cosmetics with the exact same code lenght.                                                   
For exsample if you got the Commando skin wich has a code of 25 letters (CID_016_Athena_Commando_F) you can switch it with Aerial Assault- Trooper which also has a code of 25 letters (CID_017_Athena_Commando_M) you would see Aerial Assault Trooper instead of the Commando skin  :)
